##Background
- Remote access is a telecommunication that relates to the communication with a data processing facility from a distant location.

- Remote Desktop Protocols or RDPs is a multichannel capable protocol that allows for separate virtual channels to carry presentation data and device communications from a server.

- The RDM (Remote Device Management) is a program that manages the devices that connect to a computer.

- RDP only allows one connection at a time.

- The quality of remote access is influenced by the speed of the server and the speed of the client. 

##Problem
With the power of smart phones nowadays, it is like a very portable computer in a sense. With the mobile's processing power, it has the ability to render images and a lot of other things. So that very same mobile phone can be used as a client for remote access to some computer or server. The main problem here is the implementation of the connection from mobile to a remote computer. And also, 
an analysis of the capabilities of this kind of remote access will be done.

##Solution
1. Design and Implementation

	- The hardware components consist of a blackberry phone and some computer whose specs where not stated in the paper.
	- The Remote Desktop Protocol used in this implementation is from TSMobile and is used to connect from phone to computer.
	- The Remote Device Management used here is RDM+ Desktop and its function is to maintain as well as to monitor the connection.
	- A personal web server called Home Web Server was used as part of the implementation.
	
2. Capabilities of the Remote Access
    - Uploading and Downloading of data between the phone and computer.
    - A website was created and uploaded from the phone using the Home Web Server.
    - The Home Web Server was also used to upload files to the website so that others can download those files.
    - The phone was used to connect to the computer which in turn connected to more computers in its network.

	
##Conclusion
In conclusion, mobiles are very powerful devices in the field of remote access. They have processing power which allows for flexibility with the choice for RDPs. They are also portable and compact so they can be used as long as there is an internet connection. There are only a few components needed for remote access so it is minimalistic. Lastly, as demonstrated earlier, there are a lot of things that can be done with mobiles when it comes to remote access.
