#Remote Desktop Solutions used in eLearning Scenarios#
##by A. Ternauciuc and D. Ivanc
###Introduction
---
####Pro's of eLearning
1. On the student side, consultation of study resources can be done anytime.
2. On the side of the tutor or teacher, they can grade the student's work any time they want.
####Con's of eLearning
1. Examinations are the hardest part of implementing a eLearning scheme. Checking the identity of the person answering and activity or examination cannot be done given the distance.
2. Distance between tutor and student is also an obstacle on some lessons such as getting solutions for certain types of problems.
###Proposed Solutions
---
Given the problems above, the propoents of the paper chose the solution called Remote Desktop Technology. This type of technology allows the users of the to share their desktops to other users to be able to share the current state of data on the main user which on this case is the teacher or tutor.
####Scenarios Solved by Remote Desktop
1. ***Remote Examination:*** The students will be able to share their desktop with the tutor given the fact that the tutor can verify their identity and can also help on reducing the cases of cheating.
2. ***One-to-One Tutoring:*** Instead of using VoIP or other technologies online, using remote application can make the student understand things that the teacher does on their desktop by just looking the the professors desktop.
3. ***Live Demonstration:*** On certain types of of problems or lessons, it would require the teachers or tutors to create demonstrations. If the demonstrations where done online, it would definitely cause the student huge amount of bandwidth but if it would be done on the network, it would possibly give optimal results on certain topics.
###Tools
####iTALC (Intelligently Teaching And Learning with Computer)
It is a free open source application specially developed to create a learning environment. The good thing about iTALC is it can work even on mixed operating system environment. The use of iTALC is very simple and intuitive even if installation requires special attention to the authentication keys distribution on students, teachers and administrators computers.  
####NetSupport School
NetSupport School is a professional entreprise software developed for the learning environment and runs on major Windows distributions. Similar to iTALC, this software is also recommended in a physical classroom rather than in a virtual one, even though the testing and quiz module would make it great in remote examination. There is still the issue of using personal computers, with maybe different operating systems and settings, and also a multitude of Internet connection capabilities for each of the students.  
####TeamViewer
TeamViewer is a computer software package for remote control, desktop sharing, and file transfer between computers. Even if it is commercial software it has a free version for non-commercial uses that can be used also in education. The good thing about TeamViewer is that it is a cross-platform software which can operate on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.  It is also possible to access a machine running TeamViewer with a web browser.  
####Other softwares
1. Video Lan Client
2. Skype
